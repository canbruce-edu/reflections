When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You may want to keep a remote backup. Also, you may be collaborating with multiple collaborators.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have local changes that you don't want to be overwritten.
